EstimatingPiUsingMonteCarlo uses the monte carlo algorithm to create an imaginary 2D plane which is a square which contains a circle within it. The circle has a radius of 1 and the square's sides are 2 long
by generated random x and y points and then using a formula to calculate the ratio between the amount of points in the circle and those just inside the square. By knowing that xsquared + ysquared is equal to 
the radius squared we can find an estimation of pi which increases in accuracy up to a cap as the amount of points generated increases 

Digital Rivers is a program which calculates at which numvber "DigitalRivers" meet digital rivers are sequences in which the next number is the sum of all digits of the previous number in the sequence. Every 
river meets either river 1, 3 or 9 so the program takes any number and creates its digital river and then finds the first number it intersects with one of the other rivers.

Scary numbers finds how many numbers within a specified range contain what ever number is inputted in their digits for example for the number "13" +1 would be added to the count for the number "1345" as the number 
13 is inside of it.
